# iOS Nights @ STRV 2019

**Welcome future Swift master and iOS engineer. This is the right place for you to be!**

## Introduction

This repository contains all materials and code produced during a ten-week iOS course held by STRV from March to May 2019.

### Prerequisites

The course requires at least a junior-level knowledge of programming (donâ€™t need to be experienced with Swift, Xcode or iOS itself).

### Goal

To give you a proper understanding of iOS basics. After completing this course you should be able to build a simple iOS app that is pleasure to maintain and scale.

## Materials
